       - Each file must contain a function that executes the task.
    3. A main.py file must import all task modules.

         - Display a menu showing all tasks with their number & name.
         - Let the user select which task to execute by entering the task number.
         - Run only the selected task.
    5. Use if __name__ == "__main__": script only run in main.py`.
    6. Use functions and avoid code duplication.
    7. Add comments explaining each step.
